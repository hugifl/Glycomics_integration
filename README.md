Code for Universal Single-Cell Matching with Unpaired Feature Sets

Integrates datasets from multiple single cell 'omics technologies in two steps:
* Constructs a technology invariant latent space
* Matches cells across technologies by bipartite matching of latent representations
  
See demo.ipynb for how to setup the framework, train the model and peform the matches.
